#Summary
Virtual Vigilance is a real-time AI-based online exam proctoring system designed to detect malpractice during remote assessments.
It uses facial recognition and object detection powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Haar Cascade classifiers to monitor candidate behavior, identify multiple faces, and flag suspicious activities automatically.

#Features:
Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
Deep Learning Integration via CNN for enhanced accuracy
Malpractice Detection â€” identifies multiple faces or unauthorized objects
Automated Alerts for suspicious activities
